# Sniper-bot-for-Solana-eth-bsc-with-copy-trading
You get a customized trading bot that "snipes" a token (purchases it at the lowest possible price) the instant it is released to the public, i.e., in the very same BSC block ("block 0").



The video shows my bot waiting for the coin to be released into public trading after a pre-sale (can be Dxsal or Unicrypt), then sniping it in block 0. A trailing stop-loss kicks in, monitoring the token's price trajectory. You can see it triggering an automatic sale at 68% profit, made in minutes. All facts of this video are verifiable on the blockchain.



# Buy methods include:

On regular liquidity added ("fair launch")
on token release after Dxsale pre-sale
after a slight delay of X blocks or Y seconds, to avoid taxation on the first few blocks
on key-press (if you wish to watch the graph manually on Poocoin or Dextools)
using multiple wallets simultaneously to bypass per-wallet buy-in limits.


# Sell methods include:

Instantly
after a delay of X blocks / Y seconds
on trailing stop loss percentage
on "rugpull" (fraudulent developer removes liquidity to halt trading and walk away with all investor's money)
on key-press
sell only a percentage of you tokens.
